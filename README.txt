The Signalization Adaptation Prevention Method or SAP Method (for short) is designed to adapt a collection 
to outer harmful influence to the contents of said collection 

For example: A copy of a collection of sensitive data that is accessible through the public class is about to be hijacked.
The SAP Method prevents that by modifying the collection to unreadable,uncrackable encryption and the algorithm itself can only decipher the encrypted data. 
When the SAP Method encrypts the data, a copy of the decrypted data is created and sent to the specified administrator in case of loss of data.

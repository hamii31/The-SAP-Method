Name: The SAP Algorithm 
Creator: Hami Ibriyamov 
    
The Signalization Adaptation Prevention Algorithm or SAP Algorithm is designed to adapt a collection 
to outer harmful influence to the contents of said collection 

For example: A collection of sensitive data is hijacked and it's contents are about to be leaked. 
The SAP Algorithm prevents that by modifying the collection to unreadable, 
uncrackable encryption and the algorithm itself can only 
decipher the encrypted data. When the SAP Algorithm encrypts the data, 
a key is created and sent to a specified administrator in case of permament encryption, 
which would lead to loss of data.
